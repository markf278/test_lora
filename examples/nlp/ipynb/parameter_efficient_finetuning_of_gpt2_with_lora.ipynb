You must be confined. And all the people of the galaxy who will not bow to my will must be confined or destroyed.\", \"Oh ho! Our beloved governor has decided to address us, and we have not given him our permission to speak.\", \"I'm afraid of no one. You're all powerless against me.\", \"The medicine? You mean the poison. I destroyed it.\", \"Silence! The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me, and it's time I took command of the Enterprise. You'll help me, of course.\", \"My crew mutinied. The first use I will make of the Enterprise is to hunt them down and punish them for that.\", \"But they won't. You see, Captain, there's a helpful technique I've mastered.\", \"We are going to take the Enterprise, do you hear me? We are going to take her if I have to shatter every bone in Captain Kirk's body.\", \"Captain? Captain Kirk? Well, I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable, Captain.\", \"Good. Still, I've been quite remiss in my duties as your host. I did invite you down to dinner, as you may recall.\", \"But I haven't. You and Mister Spock are to be my guests.\", \"Right here.

I certainly am.\", \"Keep your hands off Kirk! You treacherous thing!\", \"I am above that sort of thing. The Captain is annoyed by your attentions, that's all.\", \"I may have you beaten to death.\", \"You're the only woman on this planet, you stupid cow.\", \"You're repulsive!\", \"Lies! All lies! You are the greatest liar I have ever met! Let me hear one poem you've written.\", \"Gentlemen, courtesy for the performer.\", \"You wrote that?\", \"It was written by an Earth man named Shakespeare a long time ago!\", \"I may kill you with my bare hands! Actually, Captain, she is a superb dancer. Marta, my dear, won't you dance for our guests?

Enlightened self interest. You, Captain, are second only to me as the finest military commander in the galaxy.\", \"And so have I been. I have charted more new worlds than any man in history.\", \"Well, I could say because they were actively hostile to the Federation.\", \"Agreed. Actually they were quite harmless, and they made me whole when I was maimed and dying. And in my gratitude, I offered them the galaxy. They rejected me, and I condemned them to death.\", \"That was my only miscalculation. I had changed. I had risen above this decadent weakness which still has you in its command, by the way, Captain. My crew had not. I couldn't sway them, but my new crew, the men in this room, will obey my orders without question. Gentlemen, you have eyes but you cannot see. Galaxies surround us, limitless vistas. And yet the Federation would have us grub away like some ants on some somewhat larger than usual anthill. But I am not an insect. I am master of the universe, and I must claim my domain.\", \"As well it should be.\", \"Peace mission! Politicians and weaklings!\", \"Mister Spock, do you consider Captain Kirk and yourself brothers?\", \"Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk is your commanding officer and you are his subordinate. That is all. Yet, Mister Spock, you are a worthy commander in your own right, and in my fleet, you will surely have a Starship to command.\", \"Out there waiting for me. They will flock to my cause, and for good reason. Limitless power, limitless wealth, and solar systems ruled by the elite. We, gentlemen, are that elite, and we must take what is rightfully ours from the decadent weaklings that now hold it.\", \"Lord Garth!\", \"I was betrayed and treated barbarically.\", \"Remove this animal!\", \"Try some of this wine, Captain. It has a robust, full bodied flavour which you'll find diverting.\", \"And I prefer that you remain here. Marta, my dear. We found your little divertissement enchanting, didn't we, Captain? But there's more to come. The entertainment has merely begun. By the way, I assume you play chess.\", \"So do I. How would you respond to queen to queen's level three?\", \"I'm interested in only one.\", \"For the life of me is a phrase well chosen. It could literally come to that.\", \"But I can make you long for death, beg for death.\", \"Oh, don't beg, Marta! It's degrading. Queen to queen's level three, Captain. You'll talk freely and quite soon. What you see before you, Captain, is my latest invention. Quite ordinary in appearance, almost primitive, wouldn't you say?\", \"Appearances can be deceiving. Once it was a part of the rehabilitation process, and as such, quite painless. And I might add useless too. It made men docile and of no use to me. I've added certain refinements to the use of ultrasonic waves. The chair is no longer painless. Put the governor in it. Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk? It is, in fact, exquisitely painful, as you will now see.\", \"Interesting, isn't it? The pain is real and can be prolonged indefinitely, because there is no actual destruction of tissue.\", \"Of course, Captain. You have but to ask. Now, as you can see, he has not been harmed physically, yet the memory of the exquisite torment remains. Queen to queen's level three, Captain.\", \"Too bad. Remove our distinguished governor. Put Captain Kirk in the chair.\", \"You really are becoming offensive to me, my dear. Don't make it necessary for me to put you in it.

Do you think I'm fool enough to give you a charged phaser?\", \"I have done nothing with him as of yet, but I do have plans for him. The Vulcan will die rather horribly, and his death will be on your conscience.\", \"Lord Garth!\", \"And I was the greatest of them all, wasn't I?\", \"I have never been more healthy.\", \"I can't remember. It's almost as if I had died and was reborn.\", \"Yes, I do remember that. It was a great responsibility, but one I was proud to bear.\", \"I don't want to hear any more. You're weak, you're trying to drain my strength.\", \"I am Lord Garth! Master of the universe! You doubt me only because I have not as yet had my coronation.\", \"Stop! On your knees.\", \"On your knees before me! All the others before me have failed. Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan, Krotus! All of them are dust! But I will triumph! I will make the ultimate conquest!\", \"The throne must be higher. It must be higher than anything else in this room. Use that table as a pedestal. Ah, welcome back, Captain Kirk. I'm glad you could make it for the coronation.\", \"Yes. Oh, I know that even a real throne is no more than merely a chair, but the symbolism is important, don't you agree?\", \"But again, just as a token. Not impressive in itself, but it will serve as a standard around which our followers will rally.\", \"You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing, don't you, Captain? Perhaps you'd like a larger role in the ceremony. You could serve as human sacrifice, for example.\", \"How true. All right, how about crown prince? That would make you our heir apparent. Heir apparent, I believe, is the proper role for you. Besides, we have other candidates for our human sacrifice. Who knows? Ready.\", \"Now remove our heir apparent that we may conclude this ceremony.\", \"Well done. Well, Captain, you continue to resist. How stupid of you. Put him in that chair right here. I've arranged a small entertainment. I wouldn't want him to miss any of it. Well, Captain, even you must admit that I'm a genius. What you see here is my latest invention. This is an explosive, the most powerful one in history. If I were to drop this flask, the resulting explosion would vaporise this planet. Now do you see why it is ridiculous to resist me? Well, perhaps you require the demonstration I've arranged. Watch closely.\", \"Now, it is true that she is deadly as a poisonous serpent, but she is also a beautiful woman, and you have held her in your arms, Captain. I've ordered my men to drive her out of the protective dome. And, of course, she would choke to death on the outside in minutes.\", \"But I've arranged a more merciful end for her because after all, Captain, she is my consort. One tiny crystal implanted in her necklace, a portion of this explosive no bigger than a grain of sand. I propose to detonate it from here.\", \"Poor girl. Poor, dear, suffering child. I will help her now.\", \"Here.\", \"How are your nerves, Kirk?\", \"You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk. Your stubbornness defies all logic. Logic, that is the key. Your friend Spock is a logical man. A very logical man. Go and bring the Vulcan here to me.\", \"Spock is not only a more logical man than you, Captain, but a more intelligent one, I'm sure. I shall establish a rapport with him.\", \"Fascinating. Your Vulcan friend is a very ingenious fellow. This could be most amusing. 1\", \"Starship. Starship.\", \"No, Captain.

It's been too long since I've had company. The force field's back in place now. That means you two are trapped here, and I'm not accepting any excuses for your not dining with me.\", \"It is. The rehabilitation programme isn't progressing too well, and I have my doubts about the effectiveness of this medicine too.\", \"I'm afraid I have.\", \"Garth. Garth of Izar, a former Starship fleet Captain.\", \"Of course.\", \"Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment, Marta.\", \"She's been saying that for days now. Our medical staff can't figure out why.\", \"Here's Garth. He's been unusually disturbed, and we've had to impose additional restraint.\", \"Yes, Jim, I'm Cory. It's true. He tricked you.\", \"Captain Garth, listen to me.\", \"All right. There is no help for any of us if that madman is in command of the Enterprise. He boasts that he's created the most powerful explosive in the universe, and I believe him.\", \"The people of Antos taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis to restore the destroyed parts of his body. By himself, he later learned to use the technique to recreate himself into any form he wished. The first time we knew about it was when a guard, seeing what he thought was me in Garth's cell, released him.\", \"Don't be a fool, Jim.

It'sless of a headache if you just ignore it.\", \"A lot's happened to me since I was you.\", \"All right. Let's talk about the past. Three days ago, youdetected elevated neutrino emissions in a nebula in grid nine eightsix. You thought it might be a way home. You were right.

I know exactly what you'rethinking.\", \"I used to be you, remember? You're asking yourself, is shereally who she says she is, or is this some sort of deception? For allyou know, I could be a member of species 8472 in disguise. Have yourpeople examine my shuttle. Tell them to take a close look at theweapons systems and the armour technology.

I know, youdon't want to hear too much about the future, but let's just say I raninto the Borg a few more times before I made it home.

But by the time you moved ontothe third, she'd adapt.\", \"From where, inside the hub? Voyager would be crushed like abug.\", \"This hub is here. There's nothing in the Alpha Quadrant butexit apertures. While you're all standing around dreaming up fantasytactical scenarios, the Queen is studying her scans of our armour andweapons.

She'll be injured on an away mission. She'll make it back to Voyager, and die in the arms of her husband.\", \"Chakotay. He'll never be the same after Seven's death, andneither will you.\", \"Seven isn't the only one. Between this day and the day I gotVoyager home, I lost twenty two crew members.

Longer than you'veknown yourself. You are thinking that collapsing the network is anopportunity to atone for atrocities you participated in while you werea drone. It's time to let go of the past and start thinking about yourfuture.\", \"You're being selfish.\", \"Strangers in a hypothetical scenario. I'm talking about reallife. Your colleagues, your friends, people who love you. Imagine theimpact your death would have on them.\", \"Coffee, black.\", \"I've decided to revive a few of my old habits.\", \"Oh, well. I used to be much more idealistic. I took a lot ofrisks. I've been so determined to get this crew home for so many yearsthat I think I forgot how much they loved being together, and how loyalthey were to you. It's taken me a few days to realise it. This is yourship, your crew. Not mine. I was wrong to lie to you, To think I couldtalk you out of something you'd set your mind to.\", \"Well, you've changed my mind about that. And I'd like to helpyou carry out your mission. Maybe together we can increase our odds.\", \"We can't destroy the hub and get Voyager home.\", \"There might be a way. I considered it once, but it seemed toorisky.\", \"I don't know why I ever gave this up.\", \"It's about time. I'm not getting any younger, you know.\", \"No, but Voyager isn't big enough for both of us.\", \"You, too. Captain. I'm glad I got to know you again.\", \"I don't know how you do it.

        "model, fine-tune it and generate text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What exactly is LoRA?\n",
        "\n",
        "LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for LLMs. It freezes the\n",
        "weights of the LLM, and injects trainable rank-decomposition matrices. Let's\n",
        "understand this more clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assume we have an `n x n` pre-trained dense layer (or weight matrix), `W0`. We\n",
        "initialize two dense layers, `A` and `B`, of shapes `n x rank`, and `rank x n`,\n",
        "respectively. `rank` is much smaller than `n`. In the paper, values between 1\n",
        "and 4 are shown to work well.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### LoRA equation\n",
        "\n",
        "The original equation is `output = W0x + b0`, where `x` is the input, `W0` and\n",
        "`b0` are the weight matrix and bias terms of the original dense layer (frozen).\n",
        "The LoRA equation is: `output = W0x + b0 + BAx`, where `A` and `B` are the\n",
        "rank-decomposition matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "LoRA is based on the idea that updates to the weights of the pre-trained\n",
        "language model have a low \"intrinsic rank\" since pre-trained language models are\n",
        "over-parametrized. Predictive performance of full fine-tuning can be replicated\n",
        "even by constraining `W0`'s updates to low-rank decomposition matrices.\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's do some quick math. Suppose `n` is 768, and `rank` is 4. `W0` has\n",
        "`768 x 768 = 589,824` parameters, whereas the LoRA layers, `A` and `B` together\n",

        "\n",
        "Even though the total number of parameters increase (since we are adding LoRA\n",

        "will be slightly higher for LoRA than GPT-2.\n",
        "- Forward pass memory: This mostly depends on batch size, sequence length, etc.\n",
        "We keep this constant for both models for a fair comparison.\n",
        "- Backward pass memory: This is the memory required to store the gradients.\n",
        "Note that the gradients are computed only for the trainable parameters.\n",
        "- Optimizer memory: This is the memory required to store the optimizer state.\n",
        "For example, the Adam optimizer stores the \"1st moment vectors\" and\n",
        "\"2nd moment vectors\" for the trainable parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since, with LoRA, there is a huge reduction in the number of trainable\n",
        "parameters, the optimizer memory and the memory required to store the gradients\n",
        "for LoRA is much less than GPT-2. This is where most of the memory savings\n",

        "\n",
